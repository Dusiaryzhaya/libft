# libft

Libft is a custom standard library project in the 42 School curriculum, where students recreate essential C library functions from <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, and <ctype.h> to understand low-level memory management and string manipulation.
Concept:

The goal is to build a personalized C library (libft.a) that provides reliable and efficient implementations of fundamental functions, which can be reused in future projects.
Key Features:

 - Libc functions: Reimplementation of functions like memset(), bzero(), memcpy(), strdup(), atoi(), etc.
 - String manipulation: Custom versions of strlen(), strcpy(), strncmp(), strchr(), etc.
 - Memory management: Functions like calloc(), memmove(), and realloc() equivalents.
 - Linked lists (Bonus part): Implementing ft_lstnew(), ft_lstadd_back(), ft_lstiter(), etc.
 - Flexibility: Can be compiled into libft.a and used in other projects.

This project builds a strong foundation in memory management, data structures, and low-level C programming, making it a fundamental tool for future 42 projects. ‚öôÔ∏èüìö
